## 1. Abstract: The Death of the Pixel
This paper proposes a paradigm shift in digital media. Current standards like $.jpg$ and $.mp4$ are "pixel-heavy," relying on rigid grids that result in "Digital Trash"—artifacts, blurriness, and massive file sizes. VectorVision introduces a coordinate-based geometric model, utilizing real-time mathematical path extraction to achieve **infinite resolution** and **85% data compression**.

## 2. Universal Standards: .svgc & .svgv
VectorVision replaces legacy raster formats with pure geometry-based protocols:

* **`.svgc` (Scalable Vector Geometric Camera)**: Replaces $.jpg$, $.png$, and $.bmp$. It captures reality as a single-frame mathematical coordinate map.
* **`.svgv` (Scalable Vector Global Video)**: Replaces $.mp4$, $.mkv$, and $.avi$. It handles motion as a high-speed stream of geometric paths.

## 3. Technical Research & Architecture

### 3.1 The "Anti-Trash" Fidelity Lock
To prevent the loss of fine detail common in standard vectorization, the **Fidelity Lock** identifies "High-Frequency Interest Zones" (e.g., facial features in K-Dramas).
* **Bilateral Pre-Filtering**: Eliminates sensor grain at the source.
* **Coordinate Precision**: Pins high-mathematical precision to facial features while simplifying background paths.

### 3.2 CNC-Inspired Toolpathing logic
Drawing from professional CNC systems like **Vectric Aspire**, the engine treats every frame as a series of G-code-style toolpaths.
* **Parallel Scanline Vectorization**: A C++/NDK engine optimized for budget mobile hardware (2GB-4GB RAM).
* **Heterogeneous Computing**: Utilizing the GPU for Bézier path generation and the NPU for saliency detection.

## 4. Global Impact
* **Data Equality**: High-definition content becomes accessible on slow 2G/3G networks in developing regions.
* **Future-Proofing**: A file captured today will render in native 16K or 32K on the displays of the future without upscaling artifacts.
* **Searchable Vision**: Because the video is stored as math, objects within the file are inherently searchable without heavy AI processing.
